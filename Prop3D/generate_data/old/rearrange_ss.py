    allowed. If two SSSs change from sequence neighbor to non-neighbor after

    will be built to connect two SSSs that become sequence neighbors after
    rearrangement. For example, a protein with 6 SSSs is arranged in a native
    structure as 1-2-3-4-5-6. One possible rearrangement of this sequence is
    6-5-2-3-4-1. This rearrangement requires retaining two native loops for

    (1-2, 4-5 and 5-6) because they are no longer sequence neighbors (5-6 is not
    same as 6-5 because of the N to C direction), and building three new loops
    between 6-5, 5-2, and 4-1. In this study, we limited ourselves to generate
    100 MLP structures and a maximum of five permutated loops per proteins. If
    the number of permutations is greater than 100, we decreased the cutoff
